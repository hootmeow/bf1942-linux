# 🪖 Battlefield 1942 Dedicated Server (Linux, Non-Privileged Runtime)

Automated setup script for running a **Battlefield 1942 Dedicated Server** on modern 64-bit Linux systems.

This solution installs the legacy 32-bit Battlefield 1942 dedicated server using a dedicated, non-privileged account, following best security practices. It handles dependency resolution (including legacy libraries), user creation, and server installation in a single pass.

---

## 🧩 Overview

- **Single-Script Setup**: One script handles OS dependencies, user creation, and game installation.
- **Secure Runtime**: Runs entirely under a dedicated service account (`bf1942_user`).
- **Modern Compatibility**: Automatically installs required i386 libraries and legacy `libncurses5`/`libstdc++5` on Ubuntu 24.04+ / Debian 12+.
- **Systemd Integration**: Managed via standard `systemctl` commands.

## ⚙️ Configuration

The setup script (`setup_bf1942.sh`) contains several configuration variables at the top that you can customize before running.

| Variable | Default | Description |

| `BF_ROOT` | `~/bf1942` | The actual game installation directory. |
